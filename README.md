# Logging library through messaging system like Kafka
- standard logging if no message provider like zerolog
- sync/async synchronization
- buffer in memory
- easy way to plug in other messaging systems like RabbitMQ and Cloud pub subs
- easy way to plug in other standrad logger like logrus
- Authentication
- Secure Config
- Docker

Logging Levels: Support for different logging levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL. Developers can choose the appropriate level based on the severity of the message.

Log Message Formatting: Ability to format log messages with timestamps, log levels, source information, and custom metadata.

Output Configuration: Flexibility to configure where log messages are sent, such as console output, log files, external services (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ), or log aggregators (e.g., ELK stack).

Log Message Filtering: Allow filtering log messages based on log levels, loggers, or other criteria to control the verbosity and focus on relevant information.

Performance Optimization: Efficient handling of log messages to minimize performance impact on the application, including techniques like asynchronous logging, log buffering, and batch processing.

Contextual Logging: Support for attaching contextual information to log messages, such as request IDs, session IDs, user information, or correlation IDs, to aid in log analysis and troubleshooting.

Integration with Standard Libraries: Seamless integration with popular logging frameworks or libraries (e.g., logrus, zerolog) to provide a consistent logging experience across projects.

Exception/Stack Trace Logging: Ability to log exceptions and stack traces for detailed error analysis and debugging.

Log Rotation: Automatic log file rotation and management to prevent log files from growing excessively large and consuming excessive disk space.

Logging Configuration: Provide mechanisms for configuring logging options, such as log levels, output destinations, and formatting, either programmatically or through configuration files.

Log Storage and Retrieval: Efficient storage and retrieval of log messages for future analysis, search, and auditing purposes.

Error Reporting: Integration with error tracking and reporting tools to capture and centralize error logs for easy monitoring and resolution.

Performance Metrics: Capability to log performance-related metrics, such as response times, latency, throughput, and resource utilization, to aid in performance monitoring and optimization.

Logging Middleware: Middleware components or integrations with frameworks that enable logging throughout the application stack, capturing relevant information at different layers (e.g., request/response logging in web applications).

Security and Authentication: Support for secure configuration and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive log data and prevent unauthorized access.

Internationalization: Ability to handle internationalized log messages, including support for different languages and character encodings.

Customization and Extensibility: Flexibility to extend and customize the logging library to suit specific application requirements, such as adding custom log message processors, filters, or output handlers.
